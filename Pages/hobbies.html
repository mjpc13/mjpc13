                            After my I completed the Donut tutorial series, I entered on a comunity challenge hosted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pwnisher">pwnisher</a>. The challenge was to create a 3D Golberg comtraption that would take a chrome ball from point a. to point b. following some basic rules. This was my first animation project and I did it all by myself, it was a huge challenge for me but I ended up learning a lot with it.

                            I was invited to the Physis Association in 2017 and in 2019 I assumed the position of Treasurer and in February of 2020 I was part of COENEF, a commission created to organize the National Meeting of Physics Students (ENEF), that counted with more than 200 participants. After that I become the responsible for the <a href="https://physis.com.pt/">Physis website</a> and as of this moment I'm no longer part of the association.

                            I am very passionate about music. I learned to play guitar when I was 11 years old and I still play regularly! I mostly play what I like. I mostly listen to rock, jazz, metal, blues, funk (the real funk!) and progressive music and that's what I usually play.
