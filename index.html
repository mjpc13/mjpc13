                <h5>Physics Engineering Student | University of Coimbra</h5>
                <p>I was born in Coimbra in 1998, since a very young age I was inclined to the science field, first to Biology and Zoology until I started to learn more about Physics and Electronics. Heavily influenced by two professors at CAIC I started to make Physics, Electronics and Programming projects (some are described in the Project page), in which I invested a lot of my time. The remaining time was towards music, which I am also very passionate about (I have played guitar and bass since I was 11 years old).</p>
